# synchronous-source-maps
A synchronous version of the mozilla source-map library based on [@snek/source-map-support](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@snek/source-map-support)

The Mozilla official source-map library moved to being asynchronous after its 0.60 release in order to support WASM source maps. However, the Node agent requires a sync interface because it uses source maps in the processing of stack traces.

@snek/source-map-support builds what we need, providing a sync interace, but it is wrapped in the source-map-support library when we want the underlying functionality. Moreover, it doesn't support filename translations, and we don't want to be dependent on a fork of the library without a source tree (it was never published to github and has less than 5 weekly downloads).

As such, this fork rips out the functionality from the sync port.
